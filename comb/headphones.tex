\myheading{Soldering a headphones cable}

Let's say, a cable have 3 wires, red/green/blue.
Which is left/right and ground?
Let's say, you can try all possible combinations.

All permutations of 3 wires is 3!=6.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Wolfram Mathematica]
In[]:= Permutations[{red, green, blue}]

Out[]= {{red, green, blue}, {red, blue, green}, {green, red, blue}, {green, blue, red}, {blue, red, green}, {blue, green, red}}
\end{lstlisting}

What if 4 wires?

4!=24.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Wolfram Mathematica]
In[]:= Permutations[{red, green, blue , yellow}]

Out[]= {{red, green, blue, yellow}, {red, green, yellow, blue}, {red, blue, green, yellow}, {red, blue, yellow, green}, {red, yellow, green, blue}, {red, yellow, blue, green}, {green, red, blue, yellow}, {green, red, yellow, blue}, {green, blue, red, yellow}, {green, blue, yellow, red}, {green, yellow, red, blue}, {green, yellow, blue, red}, {blue, red, green, yellow}, {blue, red, yellow, green}, {blue, green, red, yellow}, {blue, green, yellow, red}, {blue, yellow, red, green}, {blue, yellow, green, red}, {yellow, red, green, blue}, {yellow, red, blue, green}, {yellow, green, red, blue}, {yellow, green, blue, red}, {yellow, blue, red, green}, {yellow, blue, green, red}}
